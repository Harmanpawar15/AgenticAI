# 🧾 AI Healthcare Claim Verification Agent

**An agentic AI demo inspired by [Magical](https://www.getmagical.com)** — built to show how an **AI employee** can automate end-to-end healthcare revenue cycle workflows like **claim verification, coding, and denial risk prediction**.

> ⚙️ Built with **Next.js 14 + Gemini API + TailwindCSS**, deployed on **Vercel**   
> 🎯 Goal: Showcase understanding of agentic AI design and healthcare automation

## 🧠 Project Overview

Healthcare billing staff spend hours copying information between EMRs and insurance portals, causing delays and costly denials.

This project simulates a **mini agentic AI workflow** that performs the same steps as Magical’s real product — but safely using **synthetic data only (no PHI)**.

It demonstrates:
- multi-agent orchestration (Parser → Verifier → Coder → Submitter → Reviewer)  
- compliance-aware automation  
- human-readable output for non-technical users  
- clear, measurable business impact

## 🩺 How It Works

| Agent | Role | What It Does |
|--------|------|---------------|
| 🧾 **Reader** | (ParserAgent) | Reads and extracts patient, procedure, and code data from a claim |
| ✅ **Checker** | (VerifierAgent) | Flags missing or invalid info — e.g., missing insurance ID |
| 💬 **Coder** | (CoderAgent) | Verifies or suggests the right **CPT code** (billing procedure code) |
| 📤 **Submitter** | (SubmissionAgent) | Prepares a clean, submission-ready claim |
| 🔍 **Reviewer** | (ReviewerAgent) | Estimates denial risk and explains why |

After processing, a **Gemini-generated human explanation** describes what happened in plain English, so non-technical users can follow the reasoning.

## ⚡ Example Workflow

**Input (text or JSON):**
```json
{
  "patientName": "John Doe",
  "dob": "01/01/1975",
  "insuranceId": "",
  "procedure": "MRI Knee",
  "cptCode": "73721"
}
```

## 💼 Business Impact (Why It Matters)

| Metric            | Manual Process       | With AI Agent         |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Claim review time | 72s                  | ~7s                   |
| Denial rate       | 18%                  | <5%                   |
| Clean claim rate  | 82%                  | 98%                   |
| Staff effort      | High                 | Minimal               |
| Error rate        | Frequent human error | Consistent automation |
